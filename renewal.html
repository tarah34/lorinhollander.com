The critical                       importance of music in education is its power to awaken                       and inspire our children&#8217;s creative vision and compassion.                       In the great music of the world, they can hear, know and                       experience what is possible for humanity.</p>                    <p align="left" class="maintext">It is time for humanity to                       recognize visionary creativity as a birthright and to foster                       lifelong visionary education. The challenge is to re-imagine                       the very nature of education, to inspire creative prophets,                       poets and visionaries, awakening talents to inspire and                       transform. Music written of divine contemplation and compassionate                       solace when deeply appreciated becomes a means for teaching                       and learning, for liberating people of all ages to open                       their hearts and imagine a better life for themselves and                       this planet.</p>                    <p align="left" class="maintext">&nbsp;</p>                    <table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#EDD4AA" bgcolor="#D7E1FE">                      <tr>                         <td class="maintext">&quot;Lorin Hollander&#8217;s vision                           for music, healing and transformational education and                           his efforts toward this goal have already brought together                           organizations such as the New England Conservatory and                           the University of Southern California in positive steps                           toward realizing the power of music to reshape the very                           fabric of our society.
