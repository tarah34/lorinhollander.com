The Earth has not undergone anything comparable                     to the order of devastation and destruction witnessed today;                     mass extinctions, biospheric toxicity, exploitive depletion                     of natural resources all in the name of a &#8220;progress&#8221;                     no longer commensurate with planetary survival. We face worldwide                     starvation, disease, war, terrorism; our families disintegrate,                     our children struggle with violence and self- destructive                     lifestyles. These emergencies call for nothing less than a                     planetary transformation in consciousness &#8211; the greatest                     in human history.</p>                  <p><img src="images/photos/explaining2.jpg" width="181" height="193" align="left">In                     this presentation, Lorin Hollander investigates the burning                     question of how we might ground human existence in harmony                     with the rhythms of life. Through music and an entirely different                     order of communication Mr. Hollander takes the audience beyond                     the cognitive and the experiential into the realm of visionary                     creativity where lost secrets surface and untapped gifts ignite                     in new inspiration. Music touches the fundamental and universal                     aspects of our souls and therefore has an unmatched power                     to nurture and guide the creative inspiration we need to assure                     our survival as planetary beings. Furthermore, music mirrors                     the waves and vibrations underlying the most fundamental causative                     principles found in nature - the very life forms we are struggling                     to save. Indeed, as a reflection of nature&#8217;s vibratory                     patterns, music provides the blueprint for planetary revival                     and spiritual revelation.</p>                  <p>Mr. Hollander addresses the need to awaken abilities which                     are not yet taught, not yet named let alone accomplished &#8211;                     capacities to re-imagine a world where we live in harmonious                     being with ourselves, others, and the universe. It is thus                     that the world currently hurtling towards social and ecological                     ruin can be renewed. Business organizations must embrace and                     universities must prepare innovators able to communicate their                     visions in ways which will awaken those enabling and endorsing                     non-sustainable modes of being. This presentation provides                     a powerful access for the audience to discover how this inevitable                     shift in priorities offers as well our greatest (and perhaps                     only) opportunity for economic growth and development in all                     human enterprise.</p>                  <p><span class="maintextITAL">Suggested audiences:</span> All                     &#8211; Corporate, Basic Education, University, Environmental,                     etc.</p>                  <p><a name="sunflowers"></a></p>                  <p>&nbsp;</p>                  <p><span class="BOLDblueheaders">Music, Sunflowers, the Cosmos                     and Me<br>                    </span><span class="subheadersBLUEital">Nature, Vibration,                     the Music of the Spheres</span></p>                  <p>The universe is shaped the way it would sound. This presentation                     focuses on an exploration of Sacred Geometry, Fibonacci ratios                     and the Laws of Harmonics, beautifully illuminated and made                     clear with the performance of music. Hollander shows the audience                     how music mirrors the waves and vibrations underlying the                     most fundamental causative principles found in nature - the                     very life forms we are struggling to save. Vibrations cause                     and are the reason for the Fibonacci ratios &#8211; shapes                     we find in parts of our bodies, in seashells, galaxies, crystals,                     sunflowers, orbits, eggs, buds, pines cones and in the unfolding                     of embryonic life. Furthermore, the blueprints for planetary                     revival &#8211; the vibratory patterns underlying the process                     of transformation itself, can be understood through an exploration                     of music. Music touches the fundamental and universal aspects                     of our souls and therefore has an unmatched power to nurture                     and guide the creative inspiration we need to assure our survival                     as planetary beings. Through music and an entirely different                     order of communication Mr. Hollander takes the audience beyond                     the cognitive and the experiential into the fundamental realms                     of human consciousness wherein creative visions and prophetic                     intuition can be harnessed to guide planetary transformation.</p>                  <p><span class="maintextITAL">Suggested audiences:</span> Particularly                     relevant to environmentalism, deep ecology, spiritual ecology,                     biology, science, as well as the arts, personal growth, spiritual                     consciousness, etc.</p>                  <p><a name="dying"></a></p>                  <p>&nbsp;</p>                  <p><span class="BOLDblueheaders">Toward the Light &#8211; Mystery,                     Adventure and the Experience of Dying<br>                    </span><span class="subheadersBLUEital">&#8220;If you die                     before you die you will not die when you die.&#8221;</span></p>                  <p>There is little in human existence more relevant to our lives                     than the experience of death and dying. Yet until recently                     western civilization has denied, repressed or shown lack of                     interest in the subject. Is death the absolute end of everything?                     Or, as told to us in the great mystical traditions, is it                     a great adventure and liberation? What is the experience of                     dying itself? What does it feel like? Need we be terrified?                     Is reincarnation real? There are thousands of children worldwide                     who remember intimate details of a previous life, memories                     which have been scrupulously studied and verified. There are                     also hundreds of documented Near Death and Out of Body Experiences.                     Ancient revered Books of the Dead are united with groundbreaking                     consciousness research in illuminating extraordinary realms                     of consciousness experienced when dying. In this presentation                     Hollander, who has participated in this consciousness research                     for more than a generation, will weave music and poetry into                     a survey of the entire landscape. Knowing the very real possibility                     that our dying can be an awesome adventure and time for liberation,                     can utterly transform the way we live our lives.</p>                  <p><a name="enemy"></a></p>                  <p>&nbsp;</p>                  <p><span class="BOLDblueheaders">We Have Met the Enemy and It                     is Us<br>                    </span><span class="subheadersBLUEital">Breaking through our                     fear of failure, unleashing creative innovation</span></p>                  <p>This lecture with music investigates the fears and concerns                     we have about winning the approval of our supervisors and                     bosses &#8211; the authority figures &#8211; and examines                     how this stifles the creativity, freedom and self-expression                     of those working within corporate and business environments.                     Exploring what happens in stage fright is a perfect vehicle                     for understanding the experience of &#8220;life-fright&#8221;                     &#8211; the fear of being criticized or judged, whether speaking                     in public, expressing creative ideas, asking for a raise,                     or facing our boards or the media. Mr. Hollander guides the                     audience through an experiential process of distinguishing                     in ourselves the true nature of what we believe is a critical                     &#8220;other.&#8221; He illuminates the dynamics at the root                     of this illusion and provides access to a breakthrough in                     creative self-expression. </p>                  <p><a name="paradigms"></a></p>                  <p class="BOLDblueheaders">&nbsp;</p>                  <p class="BOLDblueheaders">The Symphony Conductor &#8211; New                     Paradigms for Leadership </p>                  <p class="maintext">Using the symphony orchestra as a metaphor                     for the business organization, Mr. Hollander demonstrates                     a new model for leadership. The audience in this presentation                     palpably feels this model of leadership when Hollander conducts                     a professional chamber orchestra on stage to demonstrate the                     differences in the energy and atmosphere of the group when                     he is inspiring rather than controlling, committed to creative                     collaboration rather than competition &#8211; to serving a                     higher purpose. The meeting&#8217;s host joins Mr. Hollander                     in conducting the orchestra (optional) and feels what it is                     like to lead an ensemble in an environment which fosters creative                     innovation. As a model of visionary leadership, the symphony                     conductor maintains the vision, empowers full self-expression                     in each musician, and initiates an authentic ownership of                     his/her creative contribution to the orchestra. <span class="maintextITAL">(This                     can also be an experiential workshop without a chamber orchestra.)</span></p>                  <p><a name="genius"></a></p>                  <p>&nbsp;</p>                  <p><span class="BOLDblueheaders">Music, Creativity and Myth                     &#8211; Genius and Madness<br>                    </span><span class="subheadersBLUEital">The Hero&#8217;s Journey                     of Mussorgsky&#8217;s</span><span class="largetextITAL"> </span><span class="subheadersBLUE">&#8220;Pictures                     at an Exhibition&#8221;</span></p>                  <p>Just as many of the great creative geniuses were tormented                     people, many highly gifted individuals today suffer with the                     same unbearable turmoil; it is an inevitable component of                     their very giftedness. (One in seven commits suicide, two                     in seven try.) Joseph Campbell discovered that the experiences                     of the personality disintegration and reintegration (what                     we call, but perhaps can no longer, manic-depression) of these                     spiritually and psychologically different people are identical                     to the &#8220;hero&#8217;s journey&#8221; &#8211; the departure,                     initiation and return &#8211; as found in the world&#8217;s                     great mythologies. The great creators left evidence, personal                     chronicles of their mythological journeys expressed in their                     works of art. In addition to having been an infant child prodigy                     who composed music at age three and performed Bach&#8217;s                     <span class="maintextITAL">Well Tempered Clavier</span> at                     five, Lorin Hollander brings 35 years of exploring the inner                     world of highly gifted with an international community.

It also provides insight into training mentors,                     counselors and guides for these often tormented and misunderstood                     souls.</p>                  <p><span class="maintextITAL">Suggested audiences:</span> Education                     of the gifted, spiritual psychology, religious studies, mental                     health, wellness and healthcare professions, etc.</p>                  <p><a name="passage"></a></p>                  <p>&nbsp;</p>                  <p><span class="BOLDblueheaders">Rites of Passage &#8211; Initiation,                     Wholeness and Creative Leadership <br>                    </span><span class="subheadersBLUEital">Transforming spiritual                     bankruptcy in our communities</span></p>                  <p>Our young people desperately need rites of passage in their                     lives, experiences guided by elders wherein initiates undergo                     what will allow them to reclaim not-yet-recognized aspects                     of themselves. This is a tragically missing stage of development                     in our society undermining a discovery of our projection of                     fear and hatred, which is played out in the many dysfunctions                     we are facing &#8211; from drugs to gang violence, teen pregnancy                     to suicide. By gaining clarity through a rite of passage,                     young people ritually enter the world of the grown-up and                     no longer take revenge on projected parts of themselves they                     do not know. Through rites of passage we ignite forgiveness                     of what we hate &#8220;out there&#8221; and learn to love                     what we didn&#8217;t know was really &#8220;in here.&#8221;                     Music is the most powerful force we know to prepare compassionate                     leaders, nurture empathic families and inspire responsible                     citizens of the world.</p>                  <p><span class="maintextITAL">Suggested audiences:</span> Education,                     youth, parents, teachers, etc.</p>                  <p><a name="elder"></a></p>                  <p>&nbsp;</p>                  <p><span class="BOLDblueheaders">From Senior to Elder &#8211;                     Singing the Music of the Spheres<br>                    </span><span class="subheadersBLUEital">Embarking at last                     on the creative journey of our lives</span></p>                  <p>An ever-increasing portion of our population is becoming                     seniors and they also need a rite-of-passage of their own.                     They are at a time of their lives where many yearn for inspiring                     new creative endeavors. We are not prepared as a society to                     empower their capacities and fulfill their dreams. We must                     assure that our seniors take their rightful place as true                     elders; becoming authentic leaders and mentors to the younger                     generations wherein they are honored and sought after for                     their wisdom and compassion.
