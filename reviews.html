They involve                     performance at the piano as part of the talk itself. He is                     a compelling speaker, and his musical skills speak for themselves.                     He is able to help listeners contact the deepest part of themselves,                     claim their spiritual assets, bring them to the surface, and                     manifest them in their daily life. &quot;Presentation&quot;                     is too mild a term to describe a Hollander event; it tends                     to be more of an epiphany than anything else. People are moved                     and transformed. </p>                  <p>&#8220;I hope I have conveyed my enthusiasm for what Lorin                     Hollander has to offer. I have heard hundreds of speakers                     in my time, and Lorin ranks among the most inspiring, visionary                     presenters I have ever heard.&#8221; </p>                  <p><span class="quotecreditsBOLD">&#8211;</span><span class="goldcreditsBOLD">Larry                     Dossey, MD</span> <span class="quotecredits">Executive Editor                     </span><span class="quotecreditsITAL">EXPLORE: The Journal                     of Science and Healing</span><span class="quotecredits">,                     author of </span><span class="quotecreditsITAL">Healing Words</span></p>                  <p>&nbsp;</p>                  <p>&#8220;Lorin Hollander&#8217;s missionary zeal has the intensity                     to light great fires &#8230; It is the reverberating after                     effects that the true impact of his work is realized.

Besides being a musician extraordinaire,                     Lorin has a very unique ability as an accomplished lecturer.                     He was able to introduce to our audiences the pieces he played                     in a fascinating and captivating way, showing their relevance                     to modern consciousness research and to the understanding                     of the human psyche.</p>                  <p>&#8220;His last performance at the ITA conference in Palm                     Springs, CA, in June 2004, when he played Mussorgsky's Pictures                     at an Exhibition together with his lecture describing this                     composition as reflecting the artist's rite of passage, was                     a fantastic experience, without any doubt the high point of                     the meeting.&#8221; </p>                  <p><span class="quotecreditsBOLD">&#8211;</span><span class="goldcreditsBOLD">Stanislav                     Grof, MD</span>, <span class="quotecreditsITAL">Founding President                     of the International Transpersonal Association</span></p>                  <p>&nbsp;</p>                  <p>&#8220;Superlatives normally used to describe reactions to                     a performer &#8211; extraordinary, wonderful, incredible,                     fantastic &#8211; are simply not enough to reflect the impact                     that Lorin Hollander made on our campus during his recent                     visit.
